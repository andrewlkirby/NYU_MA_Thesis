SIRI and Language Learning: A Case Study

In this project, the effectiveness of using a software-based ‘virtual assistant’ in a
second-language learning context will be evaluated. This particular assistant is SIRI, an
interactive program designed by Apple Ltd. to assist users with various computing and mobile
phone tasks. It is connected to a search engine. The purpose for conducting research on this
particular program is related to the widespread use of smartphones in everyday life. Language
learning is connected to the habits and behaviors of the learners; tasks in educational contexts
should be adapted to them as such. Younger students may feel more comfortable using such
devices in a school environment.
